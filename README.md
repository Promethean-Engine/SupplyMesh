# SupplyMesh
A blockchain-based supply chain bounty system.

## Inspiration
The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the limitations our healthcare system's traditional supply chains have faced when dealing with unprecedented demand for medical supplies. 
 
Scaling from {insert mask or ventilator numbers} to {#} is an exacting task, and one that traditional supply chains and medical supply manufacturers simply cannot accomplish fast enough. Instead we see various companies like Foxconn, LVMH, and numerous smaller manufacturers shifting production away from their original focuses of electronics and perfumes to focus on producing the medical supplies we so desperately need right now.

Simultaneously we see individuals throughout communities both shocked by the trials and demands that hospitals are facing, and galvanized to help.

SupplyMesh offers a solution that brings together the hospitals that need supplies, vendors that are manufacturing medical supplies, and individuals who are invested in financially supporting healthcare providers.

## What it does
SupplyMesh creates a marketplace where hospitals can publicly post requests for the supplies they need.

Vendors can then make bids to fulfill these supply requests, competing with each other on price and allowing the hospitals to choose among competing bids.

Individuals can browse requests and participate in crowdfunding them.

## How we built it
SupplyMesh is a Decentralized Application.

The back end code for SupplyMesh runs on Ethereum.  The smart contract that defines the logic behind SupplyMesh is written in Solidity.

The front end webpage for SupplyMesh is currently hosted in 2 locations.  To support a fully blockchain based implementation, the front end website is hosted on IPFS, a peer-to-peer hypermedia protocol.  We also appreciate that for SupplyMesh to be successful, we need it to not only be functional, but also easily accessible, which is why we also have the frontend hosted serverlessly on Microsoft's Azure cloud platform to support http based access from all modern web browsers.
